# 02 — BIOS & Firmware

> Flashing a modded BIOS is **mandatory** to unlock VRAM allocation and hidden chipset settings.

## Recommended Modded BIOS

| File | Version | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| **BC250_3.00_CHIPSETMENU.ROM** | P3.00 | ✅ **Recommended** — most stable, tested widely (source: elektricM flashing.md; mod by Segfault) |
| `P5.00_clv` variants | P5.00 | ⚠️ Advanced — unlocks everything (ReBAR, PXE (need confirmation)) but **easy to brick** |

*Credits: P3.00 mod by **Segfault**. P5.00_clv is community-maintained. elektricM credits Segfault for reverse engineering and maintaining modified firmware images.*

### Where to Download

| Source | URL |
|--------|-----|
| **Primary (GitLab)** | https://gitlab.com/TuxThePenguin0/bc250-bios/ |
| GitHub mirror | https://github.com/MrrZed0/bc-250-bios (need confirmation) |

> ⚠️ **Always back up your existing BIOS** before flashing anything. elektricM recommends owning a CH347 programmer before starting as a safety net.

## BIOS Configuration (After Flashing)

Enter BIOS by spamming **Delete** on boot, then set:

```
Chipset → GFX Configuration:
  Integrated Graphics Controller = [Forced]  (corrected from "Forces" typo in elektricM)
  UMA Mode                       = [UMA_SPECIFIED]
  UMA Frame Buffer Size          = [512M] ← See VRAM options below

Advanced → CPU Configuration:
  IOMMU = [Disabled]  ← MUST disable — broken on BC-250

Boot → Boot Mode:
  Boot Mode = [UEFI]
```

## VRAM Allocation Options

| Mode | GPU VRAM | System RAM | Best For |
|------|----------|------------|----------|
| **512 MB (Dynamic)** | Auto (up to ~14 GB+) | Auto | ✅ **General use — recommended** |
| 6 GB fixed (6144 MB) | 6 GB | 10 GB | AAA gaming, avoids OOM crashes |
| 8 GB fixed (8192 MB) | 8 GB | 8 GB | Balanced workload |
| 4 GB fixed (4096 MB) | 4 GB | 12 GB | Light gaming, more system RAM |

> 💡 **512 MB dynamic is best for most users.** Linux dynamically allocates more VRAM as needed. This gives ~11.5 GB GTT (total usable ~12 GB) while keeping most RAM as system RAM when not gaming (pops1cl, Discord). For gaming-only setups, 4 GB or 6 GB fixed avoids edge cases that 512 MB can trigger. 8/8 split is generally overkill (pops1cl, Discord).

### Override for Full 16 GB Access (Advanced)

```
# Kernel parameters to access full shared memory:
amdgpu.gttsize=14750 ttm.pages_limit=3959290 ttm.page_pool_size=3959290
```

## Flashing Methods

### Method 1: USB Flashing (EFI Shell — Recommended)

**Files needed:**
- `4U12G BIOS Update.zip` — contains `AfuEfix64.efi`, `Flash.nsh`, utilities
  - Download: https://github.com/kenavru/BC-250/raw/refs/heads/main/4U12G%20BIOS%20Update.zip
- `BC250_3.00_CHIPSETMENU.ROM` — renamed to `Robin5.00`

**Steps:**
1. Format USB drive to **FAT32**
2. Extract `4U12G BIOS Update.zip` → copy `BIOS EFI` folder contents to USB root
3. USB root should contain: `AfuEfix64.efi`, `Flash.nsh`, `amdvbflash.efi`, `Robin5.00`, `EFI/`
4. Rename `BC250_3.00_CHIPSETMENU.ROM` → `Robin5.00` (capital R, no extension)
5. **Or** edit `Flash.nsh` to point to your filename
6. Unplug all drives and SSDs (forces EFI Shell boot), insert USB, power on
7. At the yellow `Shell>` prompt, type `blk0:` (with a space after the colon) then **Enter**
8. Type `Flash.nsh` then **Enter**
9. **WAIT.** Do NOT interrupt. If the flash appears to hang, wait at least 15 minutes.
10. System will reboot — power off immediately, remove USB stick
11. **Clear CMOS** (see below)

> 💡 If booting to EFI shell doesn't work automatically, spam **Del** to enter BIOS and select the USB drive as boot device.

### Method 2: Hardware Programmer (For Bricked/Recovery Boards)

- **Flash chip:** `BIOS_A1` — Winbond W25Q128JVSQ (or MX25L12835F), 16 MB
- **Header:** J4004
- **Programmer:** CH347T (recommended) or CH341A with verified 3.3V logic

```bash
# Backup first!
sudo flashrom -p ch347_spi -r backup_stock.bin
sudo flashrom -p ch347_spi -v backup_stock.bin
# Flash modded BIOS
sudo flashrom -p ch347_spi -w BC250_3.00_CHIPSETMENU.ROM
```

> *Credits: Pinout documentation and recovery methods by **Segfault** (elektricM flashing.md).*

> ⚠️ Risk with CH341A: Some black-PCB CH341A programmers output 5V logic even in 3.3V mode. The BC-250 BIOS chip operates at 3.3V — 5V can destroy the chip or chipset.

### Method 3: Internal Flash from Linux (need confirmation)

> ⚠️ **Not documented in elektricM source-of-truth.** The elektricM FAQ explicitly states only USB and hardware programmer methods are supported. Proceed at your own risk.

```bash
# Backup first!
sudo flashrom -p internal -r backup.bin
sudo flashrom -p internal -w BC250_3.00_CHIPSETMENU.ROM
```

## ⛔ CMOS Clear (Critical — Do Not Skip)

After **any** BIOS flash, settings will NOT persist unless CMOS is cleared:

**Option A: Remove Battery (Recommended)**

1. Power off, unplug PSU
2. Remove **CR2032** battery for at least 60 seconds
3. While battery out, press power button **5 times** to discharge capacitors
4. Reinsert battery, power on, enter BIOS
5. Verify CMOS was cleared (system clock should be wrong)
6. Reconfigure BIOS → **F10 to save**

**Option B: CMOS Jumper**

1. Power off, unplug PSU
2. Locate CMOS clear jumper (`CLRCMOS1`)
3. Move jumper to clear position (pins 2-3) for 20 seconds
4. Return jumper to default position (pins 1-2)
5. Power on and reconfigure BIOS

> 💡 If settings still won't stick after CMOS clear, try removing the NVMe SSD during the flash process as well.

> *CMOS jumper method per elektricM flashing.md.*

## Flash Chip Identification

The BC-250 has **two** SPI flash chips — flash the correct one!

| Chip | Size | Label | Action |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| **BIOS_A1** | 16 MB | Winbond W25Q128JVSQ | ✅ **FLASH THIS ONE** |
| SIO1_R | 512 KB | Macronix MX25L4006E | ❌ **DO NOT FLASH** — will brick SuperIO |

**Key board components:**

| Designator | Chip | Function |
|------------|------|----------|
| M2U2 | NXP CBTL04083B | 2:1 PCIe ×4 Multiplexer |
| PUIO1 | Intersil ISL95712 | Core supply PMIC |
| PUA11 etc. | Intersil ISL99360 | Smart Power Stage |
| PUA1 | Intersil ISL69247 | Main PMIC |
| U30 | Realtek RTL8111H | Ethernet NIC |
| BIOS_A1 | Winbond W25Q128JVSQ | 16 MiB SPI flash |
| SU1 | AMD 218-0844029 | A68H Bolton-D2H FCH |
| UIO1 | Nuvoton NCT6686D | SuperIO controller |

## USB Flashable BIOS Tool (Kenavru)

An alternative EFI flasher by [kenavru](https://github.com/kenavru/BC-250) eliminates the need for hardware flashing on many boards:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kenavru/BC-250.git
cd BC-250
# Follow README for usage
```

> Note: Still requires the modded BIOS ROM file from TuxThePenguin0.
